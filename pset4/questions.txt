0.  BMP= 4 


1.  GIF supports animation


2.  With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was originally in the file
    remains after the file is uncompressed. All of the information is completely restored. 
    On the other hand, in lossy compression when the file is uncompressed, only a part of 
    the original information is still there.Lossy compression is generally used for video 
    and sound, where a certain amount of information loss will not be detected by most users.
    
    
3.  JPEG


4.  First the system modifies the filename's first character in the directory to signal
    that the file is deleted and can be recycled, second the system moves all the cluster 
    to the free list of the hard disk cluster. The actual file data is never touched.
    
    
5.  Overwrite the data.


6.  It is a hearder file that provides a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer 
    types, with the minimum and maximum allowable values for each type. It is particularly 
    useful for embedded programming 
    
    
7.  uint8_t: A UINT8 is an 8-bit unsigned integer (0 to 255 in decimal). Because a UINT8 is 
            unsigned, its first bit MSB is not reserved for signing.
            
    uint32_t: A UINT32 is a 32-bit unsigned integer (0 to 4294967295 in decimal). Because a 
            UINT32 is unsigned, its first bit MSB is not reserved for signing.
            
    int32_t: An INT32 is a 32-bit signed integer (â€“2147483648 to 2147483647 in decimal). 
            The first bit MSB is the signing bit. 
    uint16_t: A UINT16 is a 16-bit unsigned integer (0 to 65535 in decimal). Because a 
            UINT16 is unsigned, its first bitMSB is not reserved for signing.
            
            
8.  BYTE: 1 Bytes (8 Bit)
    DWORD: 4 Bytes (32 Bit)
    LONG: 4 Bytes (32 Bit)
    WORD: 2 Bytes (16 Bit)
    
    
9.  The header field used to identify the BMP is 0x42 in hexadecimal, same as BM in ASCII. 


10. bfSize: The file type must be BM.
    biSize: The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
    
    
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the 
    upper-left corner.
    
    
12. biBiteCount


13. If the file can't be open in write mode then fopen will return NULL.


14. This is the number of elements.


15. padding=0.


16. The function fseek sets the file position of the stream to the given padding.


17. This is an integer constant which, used as the argument to the fseek function, 
    specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position.
